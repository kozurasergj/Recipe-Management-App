# Hello ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

I have developed a recipe management web app with the following features:

User Registration and Authentication:

Users can create an account and log in to the application.
Recipe Browsing and Favorites:

Users can browse through a collection of recipes.
They can add recipes to their favorites for quick access.
Dish Visualization and Ingredient Details:

Users can view the visual representation of each dish.
They can also see the list of required ingredients for each recipe.
To get started with the application, follow these steps:

You need to clone the repository, install all dependencies, and start the application. For example, you can use the command 'yarn dev' to run the application.
By executing the 'yarn dev' or 'npm run dev' command, the project and the server will be started simultaneously, enabling the correct operation of the application.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to reach out.
